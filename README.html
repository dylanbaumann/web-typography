<p>This project includes fonts which were paid for and owned by me. Do not utilize these fonts for purposes outside of this specific repo unless you have purchased licensing for your own use. The font is named Calendas Plus (<a href="http://calendasplus.com/">you can get it here</a>) and it is one of the nicest fonts I&#8217;ve ever come across and it&#8217;s dirt-cheap, so please pick up your own copy before using on other projects.</p>
